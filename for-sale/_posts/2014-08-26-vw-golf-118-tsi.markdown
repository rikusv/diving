We bought our 2011 model year VW Golf 118 TSI in November 2010.  We've looked after it very well, and wanted to take it with us when we emigrate from Australia, but the anticipated administration and cost has resulted in our having to sell it.

_Specifications and other details: 5-door hatchback, metallic grey, 6-speed manual transmission, 1390cc engine, 32,300 kilometres, full service history at the VW Mascot dealer, registered until 15 November 2014._
