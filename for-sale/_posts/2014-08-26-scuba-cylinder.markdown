I'm selling my dive cylinder as we are emigrating from Australia.  I've done 21 dives with it and always kept it in test (still in test until November 2014).  It is in very good condition.

From a quick look online, I believe the price new is around $600 for the tank with the DIN valve and $20 each for the boot and handle.
